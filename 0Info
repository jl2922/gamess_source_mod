Documentation for compiling GAMESS is in misc/readme_unix.

Since GAMESS does not have a Makefile one has to edit several scripts
(comp, compall, lked, ddi/compddi for compiling and rungms runall for running)
and make a few changes (mostly setting the path to qmc_setup/gamess09_modified).
lked was modified to turn off mkl

We have modified the following 8 routines:
bassto.src guess.src gugsrt.src gvb.src inputa.src inputb.src mthlib.src symslc.src trudge.src mcqdpt.src

So to recompile and link after modifying just these routines I modified compall to make comp_part
that compiles just these routines (listed around line 180):
./comp_part >& compall.log &
./lked gamess 00 >& lked.log &
